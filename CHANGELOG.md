## REL3.2.0 - 2025-01-05

Add Live Server support. While use `fewu --server <port=3000>` to call `fewu`, it will open a server in `<port>`. Server will watch the changes in `theme/<name>/`, and rerender files when it is nessary.

* `markdown:noHeaderId` renamed to `generator/markdown-no-header-id`.
* `fewu/path/noSuffix` renamed to `path/no-md-suffix`.

#### New (functions in) optional features

### Changes in interaction
The main entrance has rebuilt to be more flexible
* Rebuild `fewu --new` with human-friendly argument parser.
* Rebuild `fewu --init`.

### Utilities

#### New utilities
* `Argv`: Provides parsed program arguments. Replacing `gopt` in `#core/run`.
* `Console`: Replaces `info,info.red,warn` in `#core/run`
* `Markdown`: Provides a simple interface to interact with marked (or other parser may be added).
* `NewPromise`: Add some Promise features that are not supported in Node.js 20.
* `Text`: Replaces `#core/text_process`.
* `TemplateString`: Replaces `#core/gstring`. (Formerly `GString`, but with some tweaks)
* `GObject`: Moved out of `core`.
* `I18n`: Abstracted i18n utility.

### Code
* New `AbstractPost` class, which stores type declarations. (Do not use TypeScript)
* New `AbstractExposedApi` class.
* New `PostIdentifier` class, which replaces `Container` class.
* New `PostIdentifierCollection` class.
* Rebuild `Database`.
* Rebuild `Post`.
* `#core/builder` now uses `fs/promises`.
* use `${name}.html` instead of `${name}/index.html` for posts.
* Built-in module `search` now use formatted log.
* Fixed a bug that all files under post directory are recognized as a post file.

### Critical changes
* The old `database` or `db` API has been removed. Compatibility of `db.config` will be kept until 2.1.0.
* Use `split` `foreach` instead of `cycling` `varias` in working (as `cycling` and `varias` are hard to understand)
>> NOTE that `foreach` will be `each` in page template.
>> THIS IS UNSTABLE CHANGE.
