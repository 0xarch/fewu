# Nexo Generator

`Nexo` is an automatic generator for static blog pages.

## Using Nexo

**NOTE** Clean or mkdir `posts` `sources` `extra` after cloned the repository. Then edit the `config.json` to suit your need. This step might be completed by simply executing `npm run init` somedays(2.4 maybe), however, not now.

**For now** Simply `npm run start` in your console, the site is in the `output` dir.
